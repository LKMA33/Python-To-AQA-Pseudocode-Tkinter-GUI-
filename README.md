Python-To-AQA-Pseudocode
=======================

A simple hashed together converter written in python for converting python programs to AQA Computer Science Pseudocode recommended syntax.   

This was written initially for my own program so some parts may not work, please feel free to fork and make changes (and create pull requests)   

It is very far from perfect but will work for simple to medium complexity programs   

The program is written in python 2.7 but can just as easily convert python 3 programs   

The initial Pseudocode spec can be found here http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/AQA-GCSE-COMPSCI-W-TRB-PSEU.PDF   


How to use
-----------

Run python-pseudocoder.py

File Location - will allow you to select the file to convert

Convert - Run the main program, so convert the whole python file into Pseudo code
that then Closes the program

Quit - Closes the program


Example
